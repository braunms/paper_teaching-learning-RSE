# Learn RSE

**Comment:** This list is meant to be hosted on some website under the umbrella of de-rse.org.
At the moment, it is hosted here as a scratchpad.

At the moment, most RSEs are self-taught. However, new curricula focusing on RSE are emerging,
while other curricula are investing a large part of their time teaching RSE skills.
This is a non-exchaustive, community-driven list of such programmes taught in English or German.
Beyond the curricula listed here, there are also several domain-specific programs that include some RSE-related components.
