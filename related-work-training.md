# Related Work {#sec:related-work}

The day-to-day work of many RSEs often includes teaching activities to improve the RSE-related skill set of researchers,
e.g. in university courses, workshops or one-on-one.
Therefore, RSEs' work often includes both the use of and the contribution to pertinent teaching materials.
Various organisations and initiatives provide courses and workshops
to convey software-related capabilities aimed at the research community.
Often they make their training material available as Open Educational Resources (OER)
permitting free access, re-use, adaptation and redistribution.
In addition to training activities themselves, there are various initiatives that
are working to better understand the pathways that can be followed to develop specialist
technical skills. We now highlight a range of relevant work.

#### The Carpentries

The Carpentries [@Carpentries] is a non-profit entity that supports
a range of open source training materials and international communities
of volunteer instructors and helpers who run courses around these materials.
The community also maintains the materials which are based around three core syllabuses --
Software Carpentry [@CarpentriesSoftware; @Wilson2006; @Wilson2016a],
Data Carpentry [@CarpentriesData; @Teal2015] and
Library Carpentry [@CarpentriesLibrary; @Baker2016; @Cope2018].

#### CodeRefinery

CodeRefinery [@CodeRefinery] is a project currently funded by the Nordic
e-Infrastructure and thus active primarily in the Nordics with the goal
of teaching essential tools around research software development,
that are usually skipped in academic education.
CodeRefinery hosts a set of open source training materials including
both beginner and intermediate level material and organises multiple
highly interactive large scale workshops per year.

#### PRACE

The Partnership for Advanced Computing in Europe (PRACE) [@PRACE] offers training
in the form of massive open online courses (MOOCs), online and on-site training
events at European HPC facilities (aggregated on various websites, e.g. EuroCC
Training [@EuroCCTraining]), and white papers. While most training events are
tailored towards specialist HPC-related RSE skills, several recurring courses covering programming
languages (C++, Fortran, Python) are suitable for a more general RSE audience, as they teach coding
best practices, modern software design [@LRZModernCpp], project management and
version control [@LRZIntroCpp].

#### Helmholtz

The Helmholtz association is an example of a research organisation that
actively shapes the education of their employees.
As part of its push towards a better RSE environment, the Helmholtz Association
launched the Helmholtz Federated IT Services platform (HIFIS) [@HIFIS]
which provides educational material and training amongst other services
for an audience of over 10,000 scientists in Germany and internationally.
All of these materials focus on RSE basics to refresh and expand the software
engineering knowledge for recent graduates or to update the existing
knowledge of established researchers.
They are published under OER licenses and can serve as either self-learning
instructions or form the basis of hands-on training activities.

#### ENCCS

The EuroCC National Competence Center Sweden (ENCCS) [@ENCCS]
has created a collection of lessons for HPC-oriented RSEs [@ENCCSLessons] and
has adapted instructor training material from The Carpentries and CodeRefinery
to create their own instructor manual [@ENCCSInstructorTraining; @ENCCS2022].
The ENCCS lessons are targeted at individuals who already have general RSE
skills and are seeking new skills relevant to HPC and software engineering.

#### Education in the German National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI)

EduTrain (Training & Education) [@EDUTRAIN] is a section of the NFDI [@NFDI].
Based on the slogan "data literacy from the beginning",
it contributes to the further development of scientific methods
and good scientific practice.
The targeted education also involves research software engineering.
As described in its concept [@EduTrain2022], there will be a collaboration
with "The Carpentries" regarding their lesson program.
Additionally, the approach of how "The Carpentries" are organised will be adopted.
Moreover, we mention, that several subsections of NFDI engage in domain specific
educational programs.

#### SURESOFT

SURESOFT [@SURESOFTLink] is a DFG funded project at TU Braunschweig and
FAU Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg fostering the sustainability of research software
by helping researchers adopt practices and tools from the software
engineering community [@SURESOFT2022]. Because tools are not enough on their own but require skill-full execution, the project implements a twofold approach that combines tools and
infrastructure with education in the form of workshops and hands-on training. While the training material provided by The Carpentries [@Carpentries] is more targeted towards novices, SURESOFT workshops are focused on more advanced software engineering topics like Software Design Principles, Design Patterns, Refactoring, Continuous Integration and Test Driven Development.

#### HPC Certification Forum

The HPC Certification Forum [@HPCCF] is working towards providing a certification
process for High Performance Computing skills.
As part of this process, the group is developing a Competence Standard [@HPCCFCompetencies]
and an associated skill tree that provides a classification of HPC competencies.
This work aims to develop a standardised representation of relevant HPC knowledge
and skills which can, in turn, lead to structured and recognised sets of skills
that can underpin the certification process.

#### UNIVERSE-HPC

UNIVERSE-HPC (Understanding and Nurturing an Integrated Vision for
Education in RSE and HPC) [@UNIVERSEHPC] is a project funded under the UK's
ExCALIBUR research programme [@EXCALIBUR].
The project is looking to understand and develop training pathways and
curricula to support the development of specialist skills in the HPC and
exascale domains.
It is aiming to develop learning pathways that represent a variety of
different routes to gain the necessary skills to become an expert in the
latest HPC and exascale technologies.
These routes take into account the challenge presented by the wide range of
different technical and research backgrounds that future HPC practitioners
may come from.
Supporting this requires pathways that offer various different
skill-development routes that take into account existing skill sets and
help to fill knowledge gaps.
To support these pathways, the project is bringing together a range of open
source training materials and developing new materials where required.

#### RSE Competencies Toolkit

The RSE Competencies Toolkit [@RSECompetenciesToolkit2023] is a community project
that developed out of a hack day activity at the 2023 edition of the annual
Software Sustainability Institute Collaborations Workshop [@SSICW23]. The
toolkit provides a web application that aims to support technical professionals
in understanding how to develop their skills. It enables them to build a profile
of their competencies within the system as well as providing a set of training
resources that are linked to a competency framework.

#### EMBL/EBI Competency Hub

The EMBL/EBI Competency Hub [@CompetencyHub] provides a bioinformatics/computational
biology-focused example of a competency portal. In addition to collecting
information on a range of competencies that can be browsed within the
web-based tool, it also provides career profiles for roles
within the domains that EMBL/EBI focuses on. The hub provides
access to variety of training resources that are linked to the specific
competencies that they relate to. This enables learners to more easily
find the right training materials in order to support their career
development journey, helping them to identify what they might want to
learn and in what order.
